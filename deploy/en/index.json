	"content": "Well Architected Labs  Introduction The Well-Architected framework has been developed to help cloud architects build the most secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure possible for their applications. This framework provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, and provides guidance to help implement designs that will scale with your application needs over time.\nThis repository contains documentation and code in the format of hands-on labs to help you learn, measure, and build using architectural best practices. The labs are categorized into levels, where 100 is introductory, 200/300 is intermediate and 400 is advanced.\nLicense Licensed under the Apache 2.0 and MITnoAttr License.\nCopyright 2018-2019 Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.

	"content": " The CloudFormation`s stack created in the next chapter includes all infrastructure and the CI/CD pipeline of master and develop.\n This lab include how to improve your code quality using AWS services. developers can commit, test, and deploy code with minimal effort. The deployment and testing environment is automated.\ninfrastructure Service    Name contents     CodeCommit this is code repository, the development code is JAVA and Gradle.   CodeBuild The build tool is CodeBuild. It using Junit for UnitTest and the result is report to xml. The printed report can be viewed directly from the console using CodeCommit\u0026rsquo;s report group.   CodeDeploy Tested code is automatically deployed to the Dev environment. The code pushed to the Develop Branch is deploy to the DevWebApp01 instance and starts profiling by CodeGuru\u0026rsquo;s profiler. And when all tests pass and merge into Master, the code is automatically deployed as ProdWebApp01.   CodePipeline Visualize the series of steps above as CodePipeline. Developers can immediately find out where the pushed code has a problem.   CodeGuru When Pull-Request, Code-Review is automatically performed. Profiling of the code deployed on DevWebapp01, ProdWebapp01.    -let`s set up the lab environment using CloudFomration.\n"

	"content": " The final code is deploy to the production environment by merging the code that solved the problem to the master via Pull-Request.\n   The code for production is now complete. The develop branch\u0026rsquo;s code has passed all unit tests, so we will deploy it to the production environment. junier developers usually don\u0026rsquo;t have permission to push directly to the master branch. So, through pull-request, we will go through a code review with a senior developer or a other developer and reflect it in the master. There may be other problems you may not know.\n  Go to the CodeCommit console to create a pull-request.\nGo to CodeCommit: https://console.aws.amazon.com/CodeCommit\n  Select Repositories in Source and click on concurrencysample.   Select Pull requests from Repositories and click Create pull request in the upper right.   Create pull request, Destination set master and Source set develop and click the Compare button.   Enter pr concurrencytest in Title, for workshop in Description, and select Create pull request on the right.   -You have created a pull-request. Now let`s see what happens.\n"
